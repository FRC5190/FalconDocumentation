Week 1 Project: WordLink Challenge
==================================

Project Description
-------------------
Develop a number guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user must guess it. Provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" based on conditional statements until the user guesses correctly.

Criteria
--------
1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The program should prompt the user to guess the number.
3. The program should display "too high" if the guess is too high, "too low" if the guess is too low, and "correct" if the guess is correct.
4. The program should end when the user guesses correctly.
