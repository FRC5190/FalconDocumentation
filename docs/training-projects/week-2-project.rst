Week 2 Project: Palindrome Checker
==================================

Project Description
-------------------
Develop a program that checks if a user inputed word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Use loops to handle multiple checks and conditional statements to determine palindromes.

Example: "racecar" is a palindrome and program should return true

Criteria
--------
1. Program must use Scanner Class to get user input
2. Program must use loops and conditional statements
3. Program must return a boolean value (true or false) to indicate if the word or phrase is a palindrome
